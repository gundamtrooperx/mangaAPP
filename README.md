# mangaAPP

app where it helps display all the current in market manga volumes.  Also has a user login to where each user can check off the list of volumes of what mangas they currently have.  so that whenever they look onto this app they can see what they dont have and what is currently out to keep up on their current collection.  This app is meant for users who tend to forget what they have and dont have time to return to see what they dont have.

-what the app can do-

1. Save user login information once theyve signed up 
2. Allow user to login to whatever changes they have to their account
3. Saves any mangas they have on their list so they dont have to manually input or check off what they own
4. database can be updated on its own for whats out in stores
5. responsive webpage for computers, tablets, and mobile devices
6. drop down filter tags to filter what kind of manga youre looking for based on genres, month, and year
7. still thinking what else to add
